## Brief Summary

A company wants their user Jhon Doe, to find his packages on their website. They want the application written in React with the latest technologies. The app displays the deliveries for the user after he enters his name.


# Usage

Install all the dependancies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the app from the command line with: 

```bash
npm start
```
The app should launch on port 3000.

There are 3 pages for the application. The Home Page is where Jhon Doe will enter his name and when he clicks on the display packages button, he gets a list of all his packages.


## Features

The application can show the packages belonging to Jhon Doe along with information that he needs to find the package. These include: the delivery status, the package location, the expected time of delivery and the unique package id (or waybill number).

The other pages for login are presently being built with a backend for Jhon Doe to login and also sign up if he wants to register again.
